I had volunteered to help some grad students in the University of Toronto Scarborough materials science research project with implementing a single hidden-layer neural network in order to model high-precision Gaussian functions given a single input value. The idea is that if a given element or compound has a known excitation energy known to a certain accuracy, then we could improve this accuracy by using a neural network to approximate the Gaussian distribution function centred around this excitation energy eigenvalue. The results were that the required neural architecture was insufficient for such a desired result, since training the neural network on successive eigenvalue training data had the effect of causing the model to \"unlearn\" anything it knew of previous eigenvalue distributions. Therefore, I posit that the only way to implement this method successfully would be to ascribe to the model an attention window- e.g. RNNs, LSTMs or preferably Transformers. These models were deemed too complicated for the desired architecture and so they decided to implement the energy distribution functions directly by hard-coding the distribution function.'\n);\n\nvar draco = new ProjectData(\n    'Draco',\n    'https://github.com/DavidHostler/Draco',\n    'This one is a favorite for a couple of reasons.

This is a super resolution generative adversarial network that receives an image of a given size, and uses deep learning to \"hallucinate\" a more high resolution version of that image. This project is built on ExpressJS  with HTML and CSS, and uses a pretrained GAN model based off of the Pytorch website. That being said, while I did not train this model, I figured it would be a cool starting point to use for demonstration purposes.'\n    );\n    \n    var gauss = new ProjectData(\n        'Gaussian',\n        'https://github.com/DavidHostler/Pytorch-Gaussian-NN',\n        'This is a little research project I worked on briefly in late 2020 and early 2021. I had volunteered to help some grad students in the University of Toronto Scarborough materials science research project with implementing a single hidden-layer neural network in order to model high-precision Gaussian functions given a single input value. The idea is that if a given element or compound has a known excitation energy known to a certain accuracy, then we could improve this accuracy by using a neural network to approximate the Gaussian distribution function centred around this excitation energy eigenvalue. The results were that the required neural architecture was insufficient for such a desired result, since training the neural network on successive eigenvalue training data had the effect of causing the model to \"unlearn\" anything it knew of previous eigenvalue distributions. Therefore, I posit that the only way to implement this method successfully would be to ascribe to the model an attention window- e.g. RNNs, LSTMs or preferably Transformers. These models were deemed too complicated for the desired architecture and so they decided to implement the energy distribution functions directly by hard-coding it using principles from basic statistics. Again, this project might be difficult to parse for a layperson with respect to physics, stats or machine learning, but nonetheless it does a reasonable job of showcasing some of my programming and math skills going back a couple years, so it is includeded in my project directory...'\n    );\n    \n    var draco = new ProjectData(\n        'Draco',\n        'https://github.com/DavidHostler/Draco',\n        'This one is a favorite for a couple of reasons. I was attempting to implement a Reinforcement Learning agent using a technique called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients or DDPG for short. I wanted to maximize the speed of my agent as well. Python is known to run about ~ 20 times more slowly than C/C++, so I figured that I would implement my solution in C++ using my current understanding of the Python code at the time. In doing so, I ran into a few build issues with the Tensorflow C API and figured that since DDPG only uses deep hidden layers (i.e. linear transformations of the form Ax + b = y, where A is a matrix a.k.a. \"weights\"\", x is the input tensor, b is the bias) This project allowed me to play around with a super fast RL simulation and learn more about the direct behaviour of deep learning models from a mathematical point of view, as I had to hard-code the linear transformations and take the derivatives of activation functions numerically. If using this model, depending on the user architecture you might want to consider implementing a Big Float datatype to prevent Nan values as weights, biases or gradients.'\n    );\n\n    \n    var nattyornot = new ProjectData(\n        'Natty Or Not',\n        'https://github.com/DavidHostler/NattyOrNot/tree/master',\n        'Here, I have implemented a very heavy full stack web application for the purpose of determining whether somebody is a natural or enhanced lifter.

Additionally, I set up a set of REST API endpointsusing Django with Python3 to enable users to interact with the neural network from behind the webpage. A simple webpage in ReactJS is also written, with instructions to allow a user to upload a picture of any physique and obtain a prediction as to whether the image is of a natural or enhanced lifter.
