I had volunteered to help some grad students in the University of Toronto Scarborough materials science research project with implementing a single hidden-layer neural network in order to model high-precision Gaussian functions given a single input value. The idea is that if a given element or compound has a known excitation energy known to a certain accuracy, then we could improve this accuracy by using a neural network to approximate the Gaussian distribution function centred around this excitation energy eigenvalue. The results were that the required neural architecture was insufficient for such a desired result, since training the neural network on successive eigenvalue training data had the effect of causing the model to \"unlearn\" anything it knew of previous eigenvalue distributions. Therefore, I posit that the only way to implement this method successfully would be to ascribe to the model an attention window- e.g. RNNs, LSTMs or preferably Transformers. These models were deemed too complicated for the desired architecture and so they decided to implement the energy distribution functions directly by hard-coding the distribution function.'\n);\n\nvar draco = new ProjectData(\n    'Draco',\n    'https://github.com/DavidHostler/Draco',\n    'This one is a favorite for a couple of reasons.

In doing so, I ran into a few build issues with the Tensorflow C API and figured that since DDPG only uses deep hidden layers (i.e. linear transformations of the form Ax + b = y, where A is a matrix a.k.a. \"weights\"\", x is the input tensor, b is the bias) This project allowed me to play around with a super fast RL simulation and learn more about the direct behaviour of deep learning models from a mathematical point of view, as I had to hard-code the linear transformations and take the derivatives of activation functions numerically.
