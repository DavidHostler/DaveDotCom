I had volunteered to help some grad students in the University of Toronto Scarborough materials science research project with implementing a single hidden-layer neural network in order to model high-precision Gaussian functions given a single input value. The idea is that if a given element or compound has a known excitation energy known to a certain accuracy, then we could improve this accuracy by using a neural network to approximate the Gaussian distribution function centred around this excitation energy eigenvalue. The results were that the required neural architecture was insufficient for such a desired result, since training the neural network on successive eigenvalue training data had the effect of causing the model to \"unlearn\" anything it knew of previous eigenvalue distributions. Therefore, I posit that the only way to implement this method successfully would be to ascribe to the model an attention window- e.g. RNNs, LSTMs or preferably Transformers. These models were deemed too complicated for the desired architecture and so they decided to implement the energy distribution functions directly by hard-coding the distribution function.'\n);\n\nvar draco = new ProjectData(\n    'Draco',\n    'https://github.com/DavidHostler/Draco',\n    'This one is a favorite for a couple of reasons.

Additionally, I implemented a backend\n//         using Django with Python and created three endpoints: Products, Orders, and Cart.\n//         I deployed this basic REST API to Heroku, and used Postman to make sure that various \n//         HTTP requests worked (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).\n        \n//         Once the basic CRUD app was working online, I made use of Axios, a very useful web client\n//         for NodeJS, and basic React hooks (useState, useEffect) to interact with JSON data from\n//         the API. This would allow a potential user to view a product, add it to their cart, and \n//         make a purchase of all items in said cart once their shopping trip is satisfactory.\n\n//         </h5>\n         \n//          <div><h5>\n//              <div>I have developed a ton of other projects related to web and mobile\n//                 fullstack development, some yet to be made public on Github.\n//                 Coming soon, I may post the React-Native chat app code that I've been working on\n//                 for mobile (I was hoping to maybe get a few customers should I complete it!)\n//                 </div>\n//              <div>\n//                 Additionally, I have a few stock projects that I may have had little time to \n//                 complete but that I thought were potential money-makers, including a dating app, \n//                 a cryptocurrency payment service, and maybe a data based fitness app.\n//              </div>\n//              <div>\n//                 The latter I suspect will be difficult to monetize as a consequence of human hubris-\n//                 attempting to make accurate recommendations for fitness routines, users would have to give\n//                 honest measurements of their strength and size.
