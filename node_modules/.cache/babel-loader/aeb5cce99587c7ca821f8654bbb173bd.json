I wanted to maximize the speed of my agent as well.\n            \n//             Python is known to run about ~ 20 times more slowly than C/C++, \n//             so I figured that I'd implement my solution in C++ using my current understanding \n//             of the Python code at the time.\n\n//             In doing so,  I ran into a few build issues with the Tensorflow C API and figured that\n//             since DDPG only uses deep hidden layers (i.e. linear transformations of the form \n//             Ax + b = y, where A is a matrix a.k.a. \"weights\"\", x is the input tensor, b is the bias)\n            \n//             This project allowed me to play around with a super fast RL simulation and learn more \n//             about the direct behaviour of deep learning models from a mathematical point of view, \n//             as I had to hard-code the linear transformations and take the derivatives of activation \n//             functions numerically.\n\n//             If using this model, depending on the user's architecture you might want to consider implementing\n//             a \"Big Float\" datatype to prevent \"Nan\" values as weights, biases or gradients.\n//         </h5>\n\n//         <div><h2>Web Develpment</h2></div>\n\n//         <div><h5>https://github.com/DavidHostler/Invinzsible</h5></div>\n\n        \n//         <h5>\n\n//         During 2021, I briefly worked as a Fullstack developer for a business \n//         called Invinzsible Inc. With a small team, I implemented many (but not all)\n//         of the website's features using my favorite stack, ReactJS and the Django\n//         Rest Framework.\n\n//         Using ReactJS, I built a basic layout of page navigation to get from the homse\n//         page to the checkout and inventory screens. Additionally, I implemented a backend\n//         using Django with Python and created three endpoints: Products, Orders, and Cart.\n//         I deployed this basic REST API to Heroku, and used Postman to make sure that various \n//         HTTP requests worked (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).\n        \n//         Once the basic CRUD app was working online, I made use of Axios, a very useful web client\n//         for NodeJS, and basic React hooks (useState, useEffect) to interact with JSON data from\n//         the API. This would allow a potential user to view a product, add it to their cart, and \n//         make a purchase of all items in said cart once their shopping trip is satisfactory.\n\n//         </h5>\n         \n//          <div><h5>\n//              <div>I have developed a ton of other projects related to web and mobile\n//                 fullstack development, some yet to be made public on Github.\n//                 Coming soon, I may post the React-Native chat app code that I've been working on\n//                 for mobile (I was hoping to maybe get a few customers should I complete it!)\n//                 </div>\n//              <div>\n//                 Additionally, I have a few stock projects that I may have had little time to \n//                 complete but that I thought were potential money-makers, including a dating app, \n//                 a cryptocurrency payment service, and maybe a data based fitness app.\n//              </div>\n//              <div>\n//                 The latter I suspect will be difficult to monetize as a consequence of human hubris-\n//                 attempting to make accurate recommendations for fitness routines, users would have to give\n//                 honest measurements of their strength and size.
