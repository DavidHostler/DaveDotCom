            <h3>
I am a developer from Toronto, Canada with a background in undergraduate physics
at the University of Toronto.
My interests since graduating in 2020 have been mainly tech-focused, with a focus on backend and
fullstack development. Along the way I've picked up knowledge about machine learning techniques, 
and data structures/algorithms. 

Additionally, I dabble in fitness and extreme metal music. I'll have a personal interest page up soon 
to reflect some of these so that I can prove to any potential employer or client that I am in fact not 
a time-travelling robot sent here to advertise extended warranty on personal vehicles.
