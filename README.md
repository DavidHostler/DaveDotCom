Hi all, it seems you've found the backend for my newly minted personal website.
It's written in Python using Django (again my favourite framework for all things REST).
You might be thinking that maybe I'm doing too much to show off by adding a REST API to my
site. In my defence, there's actually a pretty solid reason to do this.

### Ok, so here me out...

Recently, I came across the realization that I was typing a lot of text data by hand into JSON objects in React. This is easy, but I find it slightly annoying to have to write massive strings in 
javascript. Having a personal console where I could manually enter this data into a pre-built formfield (i.e. the Django admin panel) is a lot neater, and would allow me to  compartmentalize a lot of my data. It's really just a tidiness thing for me.
 

Last thing here- I did not name this server after the infamous Texas cult. There is a metal song "Davidian" by the band Machine Head, famous for having one of the coolest breakdowns of all time, 
second only to Domination by Pantera or the famous Slayer's Raining Blood. 
As a matter of fact, the virtual environment is named "breakdown" because I wasn't feeling too creative when I came up with it.
